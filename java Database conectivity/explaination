Java Database Connectivity with MySQL

To connect Java application with the MySQL database, we need to follow 5 following steps.

In this example we are using MySql as the database. So we need to know following informations for the mysql database:

Driver class: The driver class for the mysql database is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.
Connection URL: The connection URL for the mysql database is jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/GLADB where jdbc is the API, mysql is the database, localhost is the server name on which mysql is running, we may also use IP address, 3306 is the port number and GLADB is the database name. We may use any database, in such case, we need to replace the GLADB with our database name.
Username: The default username for the mysql database is root.
Password: It is the password given by the user at the time of installing the mysql database. In this example, we are going to use 2744 as the password.
